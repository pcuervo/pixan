Allows access to custom meta fields on products through the API.

== Description ==
Allows access to custom meta fields on products through the API.
In short, installing this plugin on your WooCommerce site, will extend the
WooCommerce API so that custom metadata can be passed back and forth through
that API.

See the main documentation here: https://github.com/judgej/wc-api-custom-meta

== Installation ==
Standard installation - whatever you normally do.

Will only work with WooCommerce with the V2 API at his time, which means any version
from mid-2015, until the V2 API is eventually removed. It may work with the V3
API, but that has not been tested.
